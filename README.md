Recreates SpliceBERT Results and Runs Small Scale SimCSP

TODO: 
- add validation to pre-train 
    - define sentence-transformers dataloader for spliceator dataset
- re-run experiments with updated pretrain
- re-create pre-trained embedding visualization
- implement search_eval performance visualization
- upload simcsp docker image
- update midterm report 

IDEAS: 
- explore supervised CL
- use a MLM and CL loss function together during pre-train
- use spliceator for validation during pre-train
