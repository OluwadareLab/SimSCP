Recreates SpliceBERT Results and Runs Small Scale SimCSP

TODO: 
- re-create pre-trained embedding visualization
- upload simcsp docker image
- process, cache, and eda msg_train
- update midterm report 

IDEAS: 
- explore supervised CL
- use a MLM and CL loss function together during pre-train
- use spliceator for validation during pre-train
